# Happy Valentine's Day @ TreeHacks 2021

### Credit

Credit for the original hackpack is as follows: 

Credit for the idea goes to the originators of the Cloud-to-Butt Chrome Extension. Credit for great documentation (much of which we shamelessly stole) goes to the Chromium contributors. Credit for the images goes to XKCD. Credit for this hackpack in past years goes to [Sam Redmond](https://github.com/sredmond) and [Joy Hsu](https://github.com/joyhsu0504). This year's hackpack was developed by [Michelle Bao](https://github.com/michellebao/).

HackPacks are built by the [TreeHacks](https://www.treehacks.com/) team to help hackers build great projects at our hackathon that happens every February at Stanford. We believe that everyone of every skill level can learn to make awesome things, and this is one way we help facilitate hacker culture. We open source our hackpacks (along with our internal tech) so everyone can learn from and use them! Feel free to use these at your own hackathons, workshops, and anything else that promotes building :) 

If you're interested in attending TreeHacks, you can apply on our [website](https://www.treehacks.com/) during the application period.

You can follow us here on [GitHub](https://github.com/treehacks) to see all the open source work we do (we love issues, contributions, and feedback of any kind!), and on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/treehacks), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hackwithtrees), and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/hackwithtrees) to see general updates from TreeHacks.
